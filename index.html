Named 'wether jford' by the Vikings , they also built a fort on the site of Reginald’s Tower. The present Reginald’s Tower was built about 1200. In the 13th century, it was used as a mint which is a facility that manufactures coins used for currency. In 1204 King John gave Waterford a charter (a document granting the townspeople certain rights) 
  and it grew into an important town and port.</p>

			 <p> In 1492 Perkin Warbeck arrived in Ireland. He claimed to be the true king of England and he attempted to overthrow Henry VII. While much of Ireland flocked to his side Waterford stayed loyal to King Henry. In 1493 Warbeck’s men besieged Waterford for 12 days but failed to take it.
  Afterward, Waterford was given the motto which means Waterford the unconquered city.</p>

  <img class="ui large left floated image" src="images/old2.jpg">
  <p><span style = "font-size:75px;color:#4682B4;">D</span>uring the 16th and 17th centuries, Waterford remained a busy port. It traded with England and also with Southern Europe.
	In 1545 Holy Ghost Hospital was founded as an almshouse for ‘decayed’ citizens of Waterford. Until the late 19th century it was housed in part of the old Franciscan friary.In 1649 Waterford became the only Irish town to successfully resist Cromwell. Unfortunately, it was forced to surrender to Ireton in 1650.
	At the end of the 17th century, French Protestants (Huguenots) came to Waterford fleeing religious persecution. Part of the old Franciscan (Greyfriars) friary was converted to a church for them. It was used until 1819 and is still known as the French Church.</p>

  <div id="more2">
	<p>
	Such religious tolerance is a unique characteristic of the city of Waterford with groups such as the Quakers, Jews and French Huguenots, the latter settling in the south-east of Ireland in the late 17th century. 
	A legacy of the Huguenots comes in the form of a bread called the ‘blaa’, a doughy white bread bun being square in shape and covered with white flour. Such culinary innovations are further illustrated by the invention of the bacon rasher by Henry Denny in 1820 to the creation of the cream cracker in 1885 by WR Jacob. At one time, Waterford was the medieval wine capital of Ireland and was the head of the curve in relation to coffee culture, with John Aikenhead being the first to brew and distribute coffee in Ireland in the late 17th century.
